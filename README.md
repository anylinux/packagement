# Any/Packagement (`ypkg`)

This is the place for the _package repository_ of Any/Linux (or other distributions, if wished so ;-)Â°.

It's not the utility (`ypkg`) itself! It's only it's repository: the source of "rules" for configuring,
building, installing and removing software packages (usually in `Any/Linux`, but also allowed for other
linux distributions).

The base software/script is located here: <https://github.com/geleeschaumgummi/ypkg>.
